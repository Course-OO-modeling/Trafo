This is the repository of the course object-\/oriented modeling in G\+IS at the Geodetic Institute in Karlsruhe. It contains Java code for several geodetic transformations integrated in a single programm. The course focuses on learning software engineering skills and design patterns such as singleton or factory method (creational patterns). The program is based on a structure design pattern of a Model View Controller.

This code is open source and everyone is invited to participate to this repository. Please feel free to pick open Issues and send Pull Requests (see section Contributing below).

\subsection*{Getting Started}

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

Java-\/compiler or -\/\+I\+DE (e.\+g. Eclipse\+: \href{https://www.eclipse.org/}{\tt https\+://www.\+eclipse.\+org/}).

J\+Unit (at least Version 3 is recommended) to run the implemented tests.

\subsubsection*{Installing}

Just clone the repository.


\begin{DoxyCode}
git clone https://github.com/Course-OO-modeling/Trafo.git
\end{DoxyCode}


And start as a Java project with your favorite compiler/\+I\+DE (e.\+g. Eclipse).

The project should run without any Errors.

\subsection*{Running the tests}

Several Unit tests are already implemented.
